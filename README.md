# Snake-Xenzia
For our first semester project, we were supposed to implement everything we had learnt in our semester, which included conditions, loops, functions, and recursion. The project I chose was simply the Snake Xenzia game from the old button-phones. The interface and functionality has been constructed through pygame library.
